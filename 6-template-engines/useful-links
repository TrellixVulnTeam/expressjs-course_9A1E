template engines are used to render dynamic content in html file (like we had string interpolation {{}} in angular)
we can have n number of template engines. Here we are learning 3 template engines: ejs, pug and handlebars
to install template engines : ejs, pug, handlebars

npm install --save ejs pug express-handlebars
//express-handlebars have integration with express
//ejs and pug is already included in express core modules

pub official doc: https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html

Due to a (temporary) breaking change introduced by the library authors (of the package we'll install in the next lecture), 
make sure you run npm install --save express-handlebars@3.0 before you start using that package in the next lecture.
