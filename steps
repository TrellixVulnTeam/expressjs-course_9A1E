npm init (will create package.json file)
npm install (will install node modules)
npm install nodemon (will install nodemon to have a watch at changed files)
npm install express (to install 3rd party framework express js)
npm install body-parser (to parse the request body that we used in req-res section)
npm install --save ejs pug express-handlebars (to install template engines)

expressjs is all about middleware 
middleware means incoming requests is automatically funnelled through a bunch a functions by express js
so there will be possibility of your request going through multiple functions before we send the response
this allows to split the code into multiple block or pieces instead of a huge function 

basically in nodejs, we had only req, res due to which we had to handle everything in that one function 
whereas in expressjs, we have req, res as well as next which allows to go to another function  (middleware function) 
and continue working on the same req and res in another function also
